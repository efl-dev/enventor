[Enventor v0.8.1]

This is an EDC editor with some convenient functions. It was started near the begining of June 2013, so expecting it to do everything a mature script editor does is a bit premature.  However, considering its young age, it does a lot.


[Requirements]

  efl (>= 1.16.0)
  elementary (>= 1.16.0)

Please note that some features may not quite function correctly or completely prior to EFL 1.16. Newer would be better.

Please see the following sites for more information.

[Compiling]

  $ ./autogen.sh
