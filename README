[Enventor v0.5.0]
 
This is an EDC editor with some convenient functions. It's brand new and was only started near the begining of June 2013, so expecting it to do everything a mature script editor does is a bit premature, but considering it's young age, it does a lot.
 
 
[Requirements]
  
  efl (>= 1.13.0)
  elementary (>= 1.13.0)
  
Please note that some features may not quite function correctly or completely less EFL 1.13. Newer would be better.
  
Please see next sites for more information on these.
