[Enventor v0.3.0]
 
This is an EDC editor with some convenient functions. It's brand new and was
only started near the begining of June 2013, so expecting it to do everything a
mature script editor does is a bit premature, but considering it's young age,
it does a lot.
 
 
[Requirements]
  
  efl (>= 1.9.0)
  elementary (>= 1.9.0)
  
Please note that some features may not quite function correctly or completely
under EFL 1.10. Newer would be better.
  
Please see http://www.enlightenment.org for information on these.
  
 
[Compiling]
 
Once you have met requirements, compiling and installing is simple:
 
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
