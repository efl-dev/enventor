<font_size=11><b>[Enventor v0.5.0]</b></font_size>
 
This is an EDC editor with some convenient functions. It's band new and was only started near the begining of June 2013, so expecting it to do everything a mature script editor does is a bit premature, but considering it's young age, it does a lot.
 
Please see next sites for more information on these.
